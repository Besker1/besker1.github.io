/* string manipulation
working with string values is one of the most popular. Strings are objects within the JavaScript language. They are not stored as character arrays, so built-in functions must be used to manipulate their values. The functions provide various ways to access the contents of a string variable. Let's take a closer look at these functions.

Everything included
Manipulating string values is a common developer chore. 
This ranges from extracting portions of a string to determining if a string 
contains a specific character. The following JavaScript functions provide 
developers with everything they need:

concat() - Combines the text of two or more strings and returns a new string.

indexOf() – Returns the starting index of a substring within another string. 
A –1 is returned if no match is found.
charAt() – Returns the character at the specified location.

lastIndexOf() - Returns the index within the string of the last occurrence 
of the specified value, or -1 if not found.

match() - Used to match a regular expression against a string.

substring() – A portion of a string is returned. A starting and ending location 
are passed to this function.

replace() – Used to find a match between a regular expression and a string,
 and to replace the matched substring with a new substring.
 
search() - Executes the search for a match of a regular expression. 
If successful, search returns the index of the match inside the string.
 Otherwise, it returns -1.
 
slice() - Extracts a section of a string and returns a new string.

split() - Splits a string into an array of strings by separating the string into substrings.

length() – The length of the string is returned as the count of the number 
of characters it contains.
toLowerCase() – Converts the entire string to lower case.

toUpperCase() – Converts the entire string to upper case.

// JavaScript operators are symbols that are used to perform operations on operands. For example:

var sum = 10+20; 
 
/*Here, + is the arithmetic operator and = is the assignment operator.

There are following types of operators in JavaScript.


Arithmetic Operators
Comparison (Relational) Operators
Bitwise Operators
Logical Operators
Assignment Operators
Special Operators

/*Arithmetic operators are used to perform 
arithmetic operations on the operands. The following operators are known as JavaScript arithmetic operators.
*/
//+	Addition	
console.log(10+20)
//-	Subtraction
	console.log(20-10)
//*	Multiplication
	console.log(10*20)
///	Division	
console.log(20/10)
//%	Modulus (Remainder)

//++	Increment

//--	Decrement	
var a=10; a--;

//comparison operator compares the two operands.

//==	Is equal to
